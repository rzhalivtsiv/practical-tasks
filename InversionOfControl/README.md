# Inversion of Control solution
Simple project for sending invitations which implements loosely coupled design using IoC, DIP, DI and IoC container.

### Inversion of Control
IoC is a design principle in which **the control flow of a program is inverted** to achieve loose coupling between the classes.

The **control means any extra responsibilities** a class has other than its main or fundamental responsibility. For example, control over the flow of an application, control over the dependent object creation, etc.
